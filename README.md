# Simple Calculator

A simple calculator built with React, featuring modular CSS, global state management, and accessibility support.

### Features

- **Basic operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
- **Global state management**: Uses Redux for handling calculator operations.
- **Keyboard and touch support**: Fully functional via mouse, touchscreen, and keyboard.
- **Accessible design**: Supports screen readers and ARIA attributes.
- **Responsive layout**: Optimized for mobile and desktop screens.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/geneparagas/simple-calculator-react.git
   cd stasher-frontend-exam
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Usage

- Press `Escape` to clear all input.

### How AI Helped Me in This Project

For this calculator project, I used ChatGPT to speed up development and solve tricky issues. Here’s how it helped:

- **Setting Up the Structure** → AI suggested using Redux for global state management and keeping UI separate from logic, making the code more organized.
- **Improving Accessibility** → Suggested adding screen reader support and better keyboard navigation (e.g., using `Enter` to show results).
- **Debugging issues** → Helped fix complex calculations and improve performance.

Overall, AI made coding faster and easier, but I still reviewed and tested everything to make sure it worked well. It’s a great tool for getting unstuck, but human input is always needed to fine-tune things!
